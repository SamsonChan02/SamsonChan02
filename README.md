## Hi there 👋
I have a bachelor degree on Artificial Intelligence in TongJi University, and currently studying master degree at National University of Singapore on MSc (Smart Industries and Digital Transformation).
I’m currently learning about data transfering and engineering, typically about SQL and cloud computation (I don't know much on this area, so I'm looking for help).
I can reproduce and train the latest AI models on academic journal with PyTorch.
